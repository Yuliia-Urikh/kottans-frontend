## Git Basics
--------------------------
Very good start in Git for beginners like me. There is a clear understanding of the commands. I will now use Git more often.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP
------------

I liked to travel by directories. It turned out that using commands is very comfortable and not difficult (not how it looks at first view :smile_cat:). I already use several commands for sure, just every day. Thank you, it is very useful :+1:

## Git Collaboration

Git is not as simple as it looks. Although there were few commands to study, I'll definitely go back to additional material. It's very convenient to do tasks at home and at work without copying all the material. For sure, Git is very handy to post works for resumes :smile:
